  Content: This is the scenario testing configuration file for single vehicle perception/localization/behavior/control
           testing in high speed in the customized 2lanefree simple version.
world:
  weather:
    sun_altitude_angle: 90 # 90 is the midday and -90 is the midnight
    cloudiness: 0 # 0 is the clean sky and 100 is the thickest cloud
    precipitation: 0 # rain, 100 is the heaviest rain
    precipitation_deposits: 0 # Determines the creation of puddles. Values range from 0 to 100, being 0 none at all and 100 a road completely capped with water.
    wind_intensity: 0 # it will influence the rain
    fog_density: 0 # fog thickness, 100 is the largest
    fog_distance: 0  # Fog start distance. Values range from 0 to infinite.
    fog_falloff: 0 # Density of the fog (as in specific mass) from 0 to infinity. The bigger the value, the more dense and heavy it will be, and the fog will reach smaller heights
    wetness: 0
